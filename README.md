# surfs_up
Module-9 of UoT Data Analysis course

## Overview of the analysis: 

The requirement was to perform an Analysis to help provide temperature data for the months of June and December to analyze and determine if the surf and ice cream shop will be able to sustain business for the whole year round. The weather data was stored in the SQLite database. The information stored in the SQLite database will be used for data analysis and provide an evidence to convince the investor to fund the business.   

Along with SQLite DB, we have also used matplotlib and SQLAlchemy. Matplotlib was used to plot the data in graphical format. And SQLAlchemy was used to connect to the SQLite DB and generate the required queries to pull the data out of the DB. 


## Results: 


The first two screenshots below showcase the summary of temperatures in the month of June in Hawaii. The mean temperature is 74.94 degrees fahrenheit. Looking at the histogram plot it shows that the plot there is small skewness towards the left.

The two screenshots below showcase the summary of temperatures in the month of December in Hawaii. The mean temperature is 71.04 degrees fahrenheit. Looking at the histogram plot it shows that the plot is well balanced and is in symmetry.

As a second observation, if we look at the precipitation data that was calculated earlier as a class exercise, it appears that there was little rain that happened throughout the year as the mean is only 0.177. This gives us the impression that Hawaii was mostly sunny throughout the year.

As a third and final observation, we can see that the temperature and precipitation throughout the year do not vary much. The temperature ranges from 54 to 85 degrees fahrenheit and the precipitation varies from 0.00 to 6.7 cm



## Summary: 

We can see from our analysis of the precipitation and temperature that there is no huge variation either in rainfall or hotness/coldness in weather. Also, looking at the data it shows it is mostly sunny throughout the year. We can use this data and present it to the investor and assure him that there is hardly any reason to be worried about the weather and give him the confidence to invest in surf and ice cream shop that would run throughtout the year.
